# Sequence Reconstruction Problem for Deletion Channel

Since Shannon, Coding Theory has changed dramatically. 
Even new ways to mitigate errors have been proposed. 
Notable was the Sequence Reconstruction Problem by Levenshtein. 
The problem formulation can be summarized as follow. 
Suppose we have an error $\mathcal{E}$, then the $t-\mathcal{E}$ ball of a codeword is defined as:
$$\left\{ y: y can be created from x with \leq t \mathcal{E} errors.$$
