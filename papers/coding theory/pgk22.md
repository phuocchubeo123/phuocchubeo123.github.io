# Sequence Reconstruction Problem for Deletion Channel

## Some history on Sequence Reconstruction Problem
Since Shannon, Coding Theory has changed dramatically. 
Even new ways to mitigate errors have been proposed. 
Notable was the Sequence Reconstruction Problem by Levenshtein. 
The problem formulation can be summarized as follow. 
<!-- Suppose we have an error $\mathcal{E}$, then the $t-\mathcal{E}$ ball of a codeword is defined as:
$$\left\{ y: y can be created from x with \leq t \mathcal{E} errors \right\}.$$

With the original way to do coding theory, we try to shrink the vocabulary, such that there exists no two indistinguishable codewords.
In his seminal paper, Levenshtein proposed another method, which is to increase the number of times we transmit a message.

Is sending messages multiple times feasible? In most cases, no! 
But in some other cases, such as in Cryptography, less communication rounds does not always means good (faster $2$ rounds protocol is better than extremely slow $1$ round protocol). 
In the context of Coding Theory, the application comes much later, when we start to have DNA-based storage. -->
