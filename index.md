# About me
Hi! My name is Phuoc. I am an enthusiastic Coding Theorist and Cryptographer.

# My research interest
I have a lot of them :). There are several papers and ongoing projects that I have either read or worked on. First I started with highschool Olympiad problems. Later, in college, I picked up Coding Theory in my freshman year and have published some papers in this field. Fascinated by communication as a whole, I started doing Cryptography in my Final Year Project. I list some of my key papers here. In the future, I may have too many papers (in progress xD), then I will pick my favourite ones and devote other papers (including their introduction) into other sites.
## Coding Theory
1. Van Long Phuoc Pham, Keshav Goyal, Han Mao Kiah. Sequence Reconstruction Problem for Deletion Channels: A Complete Asymptotic Solution.

Since Shannon, Coding Theory has changed dramatically. Even new ways to mitigate errors have been proposed. Notable was the Sequence Reconstruction Problem by Levenshtein.
